Testfile for matrix_divided function.
====================================

Using matrix_divided function
------------------------------
# Importing the matrix_divided function
>>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

# 1. Attempting to divide a non-matrix
>>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# 2. Attempting to divide matrix with unequal row size
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# 3. Attempting to divide matrix by a string
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, "b"))
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number

# 4. Attempting to divide matrix by 0
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
... except ZeroDivisionError as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero

# 5. Test to check matrix is divided correctly and presented in the right format
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# 6. Attempting to divide a matrix of non-numeric values
>>> matrix = [[1, "e", 3], ["a", 2, "c"]]
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
